                    A great web designer is someone who engineers a website in such a way that most users never even notice their work. 
                    Because accessibility is about more than readability and understandability of a web page. 
                    Good accessibility is for some, the difference between being completely lost online 
                    and navigating your page like a pro. We use accessibility to make sure everyone can connect with the world 
                    through the internet, no matter the cognitive difficulties.

                    <p>
                        Good accessibility is achieved through several small changes and additions, 
                        and is simple enough to do that no one has any excuse to exclude it. 
                        A good example that we’ve used in our html-code, is to include alternative text to images 
                        which makes it easier for user with eyesight disabilities to know what is presented on the 
                        web page when navigating. Another similar accessibility addition is to give links an alternative 
                        text describing exactly where it will take you. This is very helpful for the same reasons.

                        Accessibility is not exclusively an html thing though, and we’ve made some adjustments in our CSS as well. 
                        A few examples are making sure the text is big enough to read and that the font used can be read, 
                        which usually means a sans-serif or roman type font, though this is not a rule. 
                        Another quick fix to immensely improve your accessibility, especially for users with poor eyesight 
                        or colour blindness, is to increase the contrast of text and illustrative images. 
                        Make sure elements are clearly separated from the background and each other, 
                        not merging into an incomprehensible mess. This is better known as Universal Design, another term for accessibility.
