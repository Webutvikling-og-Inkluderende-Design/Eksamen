                    A great web designer is someone who engineers a website in such a way that most users never even notice their work. 
                    Because accessibility is about more than readability and understandability of a web page. 
                    Good accessibility is for some, the difference between being completely lost online 
                    and navigating your page like a pro. We use accessibility to make sure everyone can connect with the world 
                    through the internet, no matter the cognitive difficulties.

                    <h3>Html</h3>
                    <p>
                        Good accessibility is achieved through several small changes and additions, 
                        and is simple enough to do that no one has any excuse to exclude it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A good example that weâ€™ve used in our html-code, is to include alternative text to images 
                        which makes it easier for user with eyesight disabilities to know what is presented on the 
                        web page when navigating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another very important accessibility aspect is to make sure html tags are correctly used. The text tags; h1, h2, p, 
                        and so on are used by screen readers to determine the order to read out elements. They also allow users to prioritize and navigate through the pages.

                <img class="paragraph-img" src="images/accessibility/color-blind-test.png" alt="Many small green and orange circles form a large circle. 
                The green circles form the number 74. If you are color blind, the number can be difficult to see.">

                <div class="paragraph-text">

                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        An example is making sure the text is big enough to read and that the font itself can be read, 
                        which usually means a sans-serif or roman type font, though this is not a rule. We have decided on Verdana,
                        a sans-serif type font designed for Microsoft monitors font and recommended for web accessibility. We also chose 
                        to add extra line spacing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another quick fix to immensely improve your accessibility, especially for users with poor eyesight 
                        or colour blindness, is to increase the contrast of text and illustrative images. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Make sure elements are clearly separated from the background and each other, 
                        not merging into an incomprehensible mess. This is better known as Universal Design, another term for accessibility.

                    <h3>Code check</h3>
                    <p>
                        The World Wide Web Consortium (or W3C) has both an <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank"> html code validator</a> and a <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank"> CSS code validator</a> open to everyone. 
                        We ran our code through these on several occasions in the process of creating this website. 
                        We used <a href="https://color.a11y.com/" target="_blank">a11y Color Contrast Accessibility Validator</a> to check if the use of colors on our 
                        website is appropriate in terms of accessibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using The W3C Validation Service, we received feedback that we could not have an alt tag inside an a-tag and button-tag. 
                        We also received feedback that an ID was not unique.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We've added line spacing and font size for the purpose of readability. For the same reason, 
                        we used several paragraphs in the texts. We applied black text on a white background, in favor 
                        of the visually impaired and the color blind. 
                        By using "hover" we have made it easier to see the links to the different pages when you move the mouse 
                        pointer over it.
                    </p>

                    As stated in the introduction, good accessibility is not something the average person will even notice, 
                    however for those with cognitive difficulties it's crucial to be able to navigate properly and 
                    be a part of the ever-growing world wide web.
