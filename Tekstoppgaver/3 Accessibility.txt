Accessibility
A great web designer is someone who engineers a website in such a way that most users never even notice their work. Because accessibility is about more than readability and understandability of a web page. Good accessibility is for some, the difference between being completely lost online and navigating your page like a pro. We use accessibility to make sure everyone can connect with the world through the internet, no matter the cognitive difficulties.

Html
Good accessibility is achieved through several small changes and additions, and is simple enough to do that no one has any excuse to exclude it. A good example that we’ve used in our html-code, is to include alternative text to images which makes it easier for user with eyesight disabilities to know what is presented on the web page when navigating. Another similar accessibility addition is to give links an alternative text describing exactly where it will take you. This is very helpful for the same reasons.

CSS
Accessibility is not exclusively an html thing though, and we’ve made some adjustments in our CSS as well. A few examples are making sure the text is big enough to read and that the font used can be read, which usually means a sans-serif or roman type font, though this is not a rule. Another quick fix to immensely improve your accessibility, especially for users with poor eyesight or colour blindness, is to increase the contrast of text and illustrative images. Make sure elements are clearly separated from the background and each other, not merging into an incomprehensible mess. This is better known as Universal Design, another term for accessibility.

As stated in the introduction, good accessibility is not something the average person will even notice, however for those with cognitive difficulties its crucial to be able to navigate properly and be a part of the ever-growing world wide web.
