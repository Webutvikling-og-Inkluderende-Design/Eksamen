Reflection tasks from module 1:
The Internet has grown into a ubiquitous infrastructure that societies all over
the world are increasingly reliant on. To which extent and how does the
internet have political consequences? Note down some examples and discuss
with your colleagues. (From module 1.3)
We discussed several examples of how the internet has political consequences. As it
is election season in Norway, examples from the Norwegian society came to mind.
A few days ago, NRK wrote an article about political spending on ads on social
media. (Eriksen et al., 2021). Political advertisements are not permitted on
Norwegian television, partially because they are considered too expensive, but they
are all over the internet. Political parties advertise on Facebook and Instagram, and
some politicians even do Tiktok dances to attract younger people. In our time, one
might argue that the internet is a much bigger influence than television. We use web
pages and different apps to gather information. The whole group has experienced
targeted marketing from political parties, and we discussed how interesting it is to
see who the algorithm thinks we are.
The effect of the internet on elections became very visible a few years ago, when
NRK in the program “Folkeopplysningen” tried to manipulate a school election.
Through targeted ads, fake Facebook events and other measures, they managed to
have an impact on the election. This was very debated, and NRK was heavily
criticized for the experiment. (Carlsen, 2019) We think that while it was an interesting
experiment, it really shows how easy it is to be manipulated.
This discussion led us onto the theme of the US election in 2016. The company
Cambrigde Analytica collected data on voters to help Trump's campaign. They claim
that they were an instrumental part of Trump's victory. The methods they used to
gather information might have been illegal, and they might have spread fake news to
voters. (Brekke, 2018) This is, in some way, the real life version of NRKs experiment.
Our discussion, and the examples we provided, show how the internet may have
political consequences, and how it may affect us all.
Consider the statement "The person who invented the train
invented the train crash." What are your thoughts about the
societal responsibility of innovators? (From module 1.4)
There’s arguably a lot of benefits for humankind as a result of the implication of the
internet/world wide web. Connections across continents and borders are something
we now take for granted. During this last year and a half this possibility of connection
has been proven to be indispensable. Todays’ technology has made remote work a
valid option and has arguably been essential to keep the wheels of society up and
running during this pandemic. Furthermore the opportunity of digital connection has
been of great value to our social life when we haven’t had the possibility to meet
people in person.
Our easy access to entertainment could also be considered significant, especially
now. However this easy access comes with its own challenges. Whilst the use of the
internet and social media can contribute to creativity, learning and social
engagement it also creates opportunity for exposure to a number of online risks. One
of the most serious worries about the dangers of young people's online behavior is
the possibility of sexual exploitation (Bryce, 2009, 320). Despite attempts by
cybercrime police to combat such incidents, online child sexual exploitation is one of
the most serious types of maltreatment online (Jalil, 2015, 137-152).
Up until now there has been little involvement from tech companies to try and
combat the problem. Nonetheless last year the US Department of Justice issued a
request to technology companies to develop systems that can detect and report
illegal content to authorities (Aasmundsen, 2021). Companies such as Facebook,
Microsoft and Google have already started to implement measures, and as of august
2021 Apple announced that they would expand their protection of children. Even
though this could be considered as companies taking responsibility for problems
their platforms facilitate. This could cause issues in regards to personal security.
Since they now have the technology to easily surveil users there's a good chance of
misuse. For the time being the focus is on flagging potential content and scanning
pictures with the help of AI. However the next step might be scanning text and
messages. This could lead to an erosion of our privacy and the opening of the
people to large-scale surveillance and censorship.
