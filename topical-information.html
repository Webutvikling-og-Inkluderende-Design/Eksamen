                        A few days ago, NRK wrote an article about political spending on ads on social
                        media (<a href="https://www.nrk.no/tromsogfinnmark/sa-mye-har-arbeiderpartiet_-
                        senterpartiet_-

                        Political advertisements are not permitted on Norwegian television, partially because they are 
                        considered too expensive, but they are all over the internet. Political parties advertise on 
                        Facebook and Instagram, and some politicians even do Tiktok dances to attract younger people. 
                        In our time, one
                        might argue that the internet is a much bigger influence than television. We use web
                        pages and different apps to gather information. The whole group has experienced
                        targeted marketing from political parties, and we discussed how interesting it is to
                        see who the algorithm thinks we are.

                        The effect of the internet on elections became very visible a few years ago, when
                        NRK in the program “Folkeopplysningen” tried to manipulate a school election.
                        Through targeted ads, fake Facebook events and other measures, they managed to
                        have an impact on the election. This was very debated, and NRK was heavily
                        criticized for the experiment (<a href="https://www.nrk.no/norge/folkeopplysningen

                        We think that while it was an interesting
                        experiment, it really shows how easy it is to be manipulated.

                        This discussion led us onto the theme of the US election in 2016. The company
                        Cambrigde Analytica collected data on voters to help Trump's campaign. They claim
                        that they were an instrumental part of Trump's victory. The methods they used to
                        gather information might have been illegal, and they might have spread fake news to
                        voters.(Brekke, 2018). 
                        This is, in some way, the real life version of NRKs experiment.
                        Our discussion, and the examples we provided, show how the internet may have
                        political consequences, and how it may affect us all.

                        There’s arguably a lot of benefits for humankind as a result of the implication of the
                        internet/world wide web. Connections across continents and borders are something
                        we now take for granted. During this last year and a half this possibility of connection
                        has been proven to be indispensable. Todays’ technology has made remote work a
                        valid option and has arguably been essential to keep the wheels of society up and
                        running during this pandemic. Furthermore the opportunity of digital connection has
                        been of great value to our social life when we haven’t had the possibility to meet
                        people in person.

                        Our easy access to entertainment could also be considered significant, especially
                        now. However this easy access comes with its own challenges. Whilst the use of the
                        internet and social media can contribute to creativity, learning and social
                        engagement it also creates opportunity for exposure to a number of online risks. One
                        of the most serious worries about the dangers of young people's online behavior is
                        the possibility of sexual exploitation 
                        (<a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781843929338-24/online-sexua

                        cybercrime police to combat such incidents, online child sexual exploitation is one of
                        the most serious types of maltreatment online (

                        Up until now there has been little involvement from tech companies to try and
                        combat the problem. Nonetheless last year the US Department of Justice issued a
                        request to technology companies to develop systems that can detect and report
                        illegal content to authorities 
                        (<a href="https://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/i/g6PWRk/apple-skal-skanne-mobiler-for-overgreps
                        bilder-eksperter-frykter-angre" target="_blank">Aasmundsen, 2021</a>). Companies such as Facebook,
                        Microsoft and Google have already started to implement measures, and as of august
                        2021 Apple announced that they would expand their protection of children. Even
                        though this could be considered as companies taking responsibility for problems
                        their platforms facilitate. This could cause issues in regards to personal security.
                        Since they now have the technology to easily surveil users there's a good chance of
                        misuse. For the time being the focus is on flagging potential content and scanning
                        pictures with the help of AI. However the next step might be scanning text and
                        messages. This could lead to an erosion of our privacy and the opening of the
                        people to large-scale surveillance and censorship.
